Kwiki-Edit-BackgroundSave

Adds a button to the edit screen which will allow a user to save without
existing the page. By default this button is called "BACKGROUND SAVE" but
it can be configured to be something else. I often suggest it be configured
to be simply "SAVE" and reconfigure the normal save button to be "FINISH".

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    kwiki -install Kwiki::Edit::BackgroundSave
